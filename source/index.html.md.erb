# <%= current_page.data.title %>

This site documents some of the technical decisions that the
[Ministry of Justice](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ministry-of-justice)
 (MOJ) has made for the products we operate.

It complements the [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual),
which covers service design more broadly.

[Security guidance](https://ministryofjustice.github.io/security-guidance/) is an accompanying source of security-specific guidance.

# The Title of Your Page

Introduction of a couple of paragraphs to explain why the thing you're
writing about is important. The [title should probably be a verb, not a
noun][good-services-are-verbs] (e.g. “Storing source code”, not “Code
repositories”).

## User needs

Why do we do this thing? Who is it helping?

## Principles

What broad approaches do we follow when we do this thing?

## Tools

What specific bits of software (commercial or open source) do
we use to help us do this thing?
```

The service manual has some useful information on [learning about and writing user needs](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-research/start-by-learning-user-needs).
