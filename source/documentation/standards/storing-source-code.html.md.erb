# <%= current_page.data.title %>

All our source code is open by default, and stored on well-known,
public code hosting services. At the MOJ, we use GitHub.

We follow the principles set out in the service manual for managing the
code that we write:

- [use version control](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/maintaining-version-control-in-coding)
- [make source code open](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/making-source-code-open-and-reusable)

You should keep secrets separate from source code, and keep them private.

## GitHub

New repositories for products and services live in the
[ministryofjustice organisation](https://github.com/ministryofjustice)
on GitHub.

Repositories should be [clearly named](naming-things.html)
and have an [appropriate licence](licencing-software-or-code.html)
and enough documentation that someone new can get started with the
project.

Creating a new project from this [template repository] will add the
correct licence file, as well as adding our organisation default
`.gitignore` file and [github actions].

If your repository contains secrets rather than code, make it private
and restrict the people who have access to it. Discuss with the
security engineering team whether you should encrypt the contents of
the repository.

### Private repositories

By default, any [ministryofjustice organisation](https://github.com/ministryofjustice) member has no additional privileges. This means they can clone and pull public and internal repos only. Internal repos are essentially org-public, and anyone in the organisation can interact with them. Unless explicitly and strictly defined on a per-repository basis to override default permissions: private repositories should be considered "private" to your team/project.

Delivery teams are responsible for setting correct permissions on their repos.
This includes ensuring the right users have access, and removing privileges when
they leave the team. It's often helpful to manage permissions across all of a
delivery team's GitHub repositories in one place, by setting up a GitHub team
for the people on a delivery team, and giving that GitHub team read/write
privileges for the repos.

### GitHub access

#### Your account

If you already have a GitHub account from before you joined MOJ, you can choose to use it at MOJ or create a new one. Some people prefer to have continuity with previous work; others value the separation.

You must [add your MOJ email address to your
account](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-email-address-to-your-github-account/).
It doesn't matter if it's the 'primary email' or not and it's ok to make it private.
You may want to [use that email for notifications](https://help.github.com/articles/managing-notification-emails-for-organizations/).

In preparation for when you leave MoJ, it's suggested you add a home email
address to your account as the 'backup email'. The reason is that the account is
yours, not MoJ's, so it remains your responsibility. When you leave you should
actively close or keep control of the account. Whilst you won't retain MOJ repo
permissions, you may have to relinquish other access you've gained in the course
of your work (for example cross-government work) - check your user settings for Organizations, Repos and
Applications. And it might be prudent to retain the ability to change your
account's public profile or delete public comments. Home email addresses are not
exposed to GitHub organisation admins, aside from what is already public.

You don't have to use your real name or photo - just let your colleagues know
your username.

#### Member of the MoJ organisation

Being a **member** of the MoJ organisation is for staff who are permanent employees or contractors working directly with the MoJ.

To be added to the `ministryofjustice` organisation, first ensure you've enabled two-factor authentication.
Then make a request on ServiceNow:
[GitHub for D&T staff - Add/Remove](https://mojprod.service-now.com/moj_sp?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=5beac6f7dbdc609050fbbfce3b96191f)
(or ask a member of the webops team).

#### Outside Collaborator

Being an **outside collaborator** is for third party suppliers who are maintaining code on behalf of the MoJ. 

Outside collaborators can only access specific repositories and are limited in what they can do within the MoJ organisation. They are not able to access private repositories outside of the ones they've been assigned to. They do not have access to the Cloud Platform cluster. 

Users do not require an MoJ email address to be added as outside collaborators.

You can add outside collaborators using the [github-collaborators] tool.
