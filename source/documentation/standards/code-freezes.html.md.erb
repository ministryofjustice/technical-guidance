Teams building systems for the MOJ should avoid code freezes whenever
possible as they generally increase the risks to your service and those
services around it.

While code freezes are intended to reduce uncertainty and change when
making changes to a system, they are typically a symptom of low trust
in existing change processes around a given system, or of a previous
traumatic event in the system's past.

In most cases, it is better to make the system safer to change through
[smaller, more regular changes](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/deploying-software-regularly)
because [regular releases reduce risk](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/11/02/regular-releases-reduce-risk/).

## Code freezes introduce many risks

There are various types of risk that code freezes introduce, both to
the team's ability to resolve incidents and to the risk and impact
profile of changes before, during, and after the code freeze.

### Exceptional processes create uncertainty, and risk extending incidents

In a team's day-to-day work, they will use a standard process for
releasing changes to their systems. If they make changes regularly ([as
they should](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/deploying-software-regularly)),
they will be practiced experts in their normal processes. These
processes will likely be well documented, well tested, automated, and
easily reverted.

Even during a code freeze, however, incidents can happen that are out of
everyone's control, and that cannot be resolved without making changes.

Code freezes can introduce a new process with which the team may not be
familiar. Using an unfamiliar process, even a well-documented one, is
likely to result in the team making mistakes. If this process needs to
be enacted during an incident—an already high-pressure situation, often
outside business hours—the likelihood of a mistake is significantly
increased.

If the code freeze exceptions process also involves sign-off from a
named person or small group, those people may also not be available
when needed, potentially extending the incident until they can be
reached.

### Changes can be rushed to ship before the freeze

If a code freeze is well publicised, teams may want to make sure their
work is shipped before the code freeze to avoid being blocked by it.
This can often mean that the team rushes to include changes that aren't
ready yet, and which may not have been fully tested. These rushed
changes may risk the stability and predictability of the system such
that it suffers an outage during the code freeze, requiring further
changes (or rolling back of changes) to resolve it.

### Changes made during the code freeze are waste until they can be released

From the perspective of a system's user, any work to change that system
whose results aren't released to them are a form of waste. This means
that any changes made during a code freeze that are unable to be
released to users (or progress toward users) are a form of wasted
effort.

This creates the risk that, by the time the change can be released, it
will not meet the user's need and, thus, will have to be removed or
replaced. The longer the change is held back by the code freeze, the
greater the risk of any change being waste becomes.

### Batches of changes shipped immediately after the code freeze are high risk

If changes are made to the system but not released during a code
freeze, those changes will need to be released after the code freeze is
lifted. When that happens, there may be a large batch of changes
waiting to be released.

If these changes are all released at once or in quick succession and an
issue occurs, their interactions may not be clearly understood,
increasing the risk they present to the system compared to being
released independently. Further, releasing them as a batch makes
remediation of any issues that occur more complicated.

### Change freezes are typically ill-defined, creating ambiguity

When change freezes are instigated, they often have an unclear or
extended time-frame, or are applied to any systems that interact with a
system undergoing significant change. This can have unexpected impacts,
and extends those risks described above to every affected system and all
their connections, creating a growing sphere of increased risk around
the system undergoing a change freeze.

Change freezes often cannot be applied to certain systems, however: for
example, many suppliers' practices and contracts are such that they do
not follow requested change freezes. Typically, this is because they
cannot accept the risks described above impacting other users of their
systems, especially in cloud-hosted or other multi-tenant environments.
If these suppliers require changes during a code freeze, the changes
may have to be made through an exceptional process (with all the risks
that entails), or risk violating the supplier's contract.

## Code freezes can be appropriate in limited circumstances

A code freeze may, despite all the risks outlined above, still be
appropriate for your system if all these conditions are true:

- The code freeze only applies to one system, or a small, closely
  related cluster of systems, all maintained by a group working on one
  problem.
- The code freeze is time-limited to a very short window of at most a
  few days, preferably outside working hours.
- No other work is planned on the system under code freeze during the
  specified window.
- Confidence in the team's ability to change the system predictably and
  regularly is low, and the effort to raise this confidence is
  significantly higher than the risk of the code freeze, or the work
  the code freeze permits would enable such changes.
- Work is planned, after the code freeze, to remove or reduce the need
  for future code freezes.
- The process to request exceptions to the code freeze is well
  documented and understood by all those who may be impacted by it
  (including teams whose systems interact with the system under code
  freeze).

If you cannot meet all those conditions, a code freeze will likely
introduce more risk to your system. In that case, you should work to
either meet these conditions or, preferably, iterate the system such
that a code freeze is not required to make changes.
