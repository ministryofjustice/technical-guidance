# <%= current_page.data.title %>

At MOJ you must use the [Cloud Platform]
(https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/) to host your
service by default, unless you're advised otherwise by a member of the
[hosting team](https://peoplefinder.service.gov.uk/teams/hosting). This
includes applications that would otherwise sit in your own infrastructure if
you have it.

If your team needs to host legacy services, you should plan to use the
[Modernisation Platform]
(https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/#modernisation-platform).

## Cloud Platform

The Cloud Platform is a modern hosting platform for digital services:

- It makes it quick and easy to 'just deploy an app'
- Teams get the features they need to operate their service, such as easy
  scalability, zero downtime deploys, security scanning, monitoring, logging,
  and more, all set up for you by default
- When you need the full power of AWS or Kubernetes, it's all available
- Configuration is all self-service, using Infrastructure as Code with managed
  CI/CD and GitOps processes
- The Cloud Platform team manage the hosting and provide support for the
  platform
- You can host [GOV.UK Prototype Kit sites]
  (https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/documentation/getting-started/prototype-kit.html#create-a-gov-uk-prototype-kit-site)
  quickly and easily

Your team can get started on the Cloud Platform without letting anyone know;
just follow the [Cloud Platform documentation]
(https://user-guide.cloud-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/#cloud-platform-user-guide)
and get in touch with the Cloud Platform team if you need help.

## Modernisation Platform

The Modernisation Platform is a cloud-first hosting platform for legacy
applications. It's currently in development, and you can become an early
adopter by following the [Modernisation Platform user guide]
(https://user-guide.modernisation-platform.service.justice.gov.uk/#modernisation-platform).

- It will make it easy to create non-Kubernetes environments for applications
- It will align with the MOJ [Security Guidance]
  (https://security-guidance.service.justice.gov.uk/baseline-aws-accounts/#baseline-for-amazon-web-services-accounts)
- It will standardise commonalities across applications, such as: application
  networking, certificate management, CI/CD processes; with infrastructure as
  code
- It will support you modernising your applications

## Other hosting infrastructure

If you think your service might require other hosting, whether in AWS, Azure, or
anything else, [get in touch with the hosting team]
(mailto:hosting-leads@digital.justice.gov.uk) and we'll help identify which of
our other hosting options is best for your service, or set up extra accounts if
we've already identified the right setup for you. This includes:

- LAA AWS and 6Degrees infrastructure
- HMPPS Azure infrastructure
- Self-managed infrastructure, in AWS or Azure
- Retirement infrastructure

If you self-manage your own infrastructure, you should consider moving it to
the [Cloud Platform](#cloud-platform) or the [Modernisation Platform]
(#modernisation-platform).

## We use public cloud hosting by default

We follow the [Government Cloud First policy]
(https://www.gov.uk/guidance/government-cloud-first-policy) and use public
cloud "Platform as a Service" (PaaS) and "Infrastructure as a Service"
(IaaS) infrastructure to host our services.

Our choice of platforms:

- are highly scalable and available to meet the needs of service users
- have automated tools for MOJ administrators to manage their environments
- standardise infrastructure across MOJ
- help reduce cost across MOJ
- support building capability across the department rather than in silos

We currently use [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/) by default
for scalable computing, storage and deployment services, but we may recommend
some services are hosted in [Microsoft Azure]
(https://azure.microsoft.com/), based on the needs of the service and its
relationship to other services already in Azure.

If your service is currently hosted outside of AWS or Azure, get in touch with
the [Modernisation Platform team]
(https://peoplefinder.service.gov.uk/teams/modernisation-platform) to plan for
its future hosting.

## We pay for hosting centrally by default

By default, we pay for all use of AWS and Azure services across MOJ
(excluding HMCTS) centrally.

As part of this, the hosting team will routinely review your use of hosting to
ensure you're using infrastructure appropriately, keeping it secure and up to
date, and making the best use of the money you're spending.

If your service or services cost more than £30,000 per year to host, we may need
to cross-charge you for your use. Cross-charging typically only applies to very
large services or teams, and we currently only cross-charge two groups.

If we do need to cross-charge you, we will still work with you to ensure you're
using infrastructure appropriately and safely.
