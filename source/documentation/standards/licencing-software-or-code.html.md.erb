Everything we produce or use, whether open or closed, should have an
appropriate licence applied (as [indicated by the service
manual][service manual licencing]). Without a licence, others (even
within the MOJ) have no way of knowing for sure if they can use it, or
how.

At the MOJ, we use the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

## Applying the MIT License to our work

### Each repository should include a licence file

This should be called `LICENCE` or `LICENCE.md`.

"License" is the U.S. English spelling. We prefer the use of "Licence", which is the U.K. English spelling, however either is acceptable. GitHub will still show licence details for the British English spelling.

Make sure the license content is included in full, including the title
"The MIT License", so that readers are quickly able to see what licence
is being used.

### Use the correct copyright notice

The Copyright is Crown Copyright; you can put "Ministry of Justice" in
brackets. For example:

```
Copyright (c) 2017 Crown Copyright (Ministry of Justice)
```

The year should be the year the code was first published. Where the
code is continually updated with significant changes, the year can be
shown as a period from first to most recent update (e.g. 2015-2017).

### Example

This is an [example of our licence](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/template-repository/blob/main/LICENSE).

## Reusing or incorporating others' work

If a repository or package you want to reuse or build on doesn't have a
licence, we can't be sure we legally have the right to use it in the
way we want.

When adapting an existing project, or incorporating code from one, you
should provide proper attribution to the source in your licence.
There's a good [guide to proper copyright and licence
attribution](https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2014/07/08/proper-copyrightlicense-attribution-for-themes/)
from the WordPress Theme Review Team.

[This repository's licence file](https://github.com/ministryofjustice/technical-guidance/blob/main/LICENSE)
is a good example of how to attribute incorporated works' licences.
