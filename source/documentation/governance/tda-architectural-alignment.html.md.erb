## Introduction

This guidance has been designed to help project teams submitting proposals to the Technical Design Authority (TDA) using the [TDA Submission Template](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/TechnicalDesignAuthority219/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B82C7FC30-FDB4-4679-AD4E-BD5EDCEFD1A1%7D&file=TDA_Submission_Template_2.0.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true).

Teams are asked to supply details of how their proposal meets specified criteria in three areas - architecture, security and data.

This section contains information on each item listed the "Architectural Alignment" section of the presentation, and provides guidance by attempting to answer three questions.

- **What** does the item mean in this context?

- **Why** does the item need to be addressed?

- **How** would a team go about meeting the item requirements?


## Re-use before Buy, buy before build 

**What?** – Sharing and re-using existing resources (technology, data, services) is encouraged before purchasing any technology, and buying a technology solution is recommended before building from scratch. Benefits include avoiding duplication, speeding up the initial project phases and lowering costs. 

Why - Your proposal needs to show you’ve considered whether you can share and re-use technology to comply with TCoP point 8.  

To comply with TCoP point 11 your proposal must demonstrate  

the user need/problem you need to solve 

your decision process for building or buying any technology 

how your proposal meets user needs and solves or mitigates your problem 

how you’re following government contractual limitations 

Your proposal should also include details on increasing sustainability to comply with TCoP point 12. 

The spend control process requires you to demonstrate you are meeting the requirements for TCoP point 8 and TCoP point 11. 

How? – Explore the potential for re-use and sharing technology in the guidance for TCoP point 8 and developing a purchasing strategy in TCoP point 11. Section 11 of the GOV.UK service standard also includes guidance on choosing the right tools and technology.
