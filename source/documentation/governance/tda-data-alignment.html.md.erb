## Introduction

This guidance has been designed to help project teams submitting proposals to the Technical Design Authority (TDA) using the [TDA Submission Template](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/TechnicalDesignAuthority219/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B82C7FC30-FDB4-4679-AD4E-BD5EDCEFD1A1%7D&file=TDA_Submission_Template_2.0.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true).

Teams are asked to supply details of how their proposal meets specified criteria in three areas - architecture, security and data.

This section contains information on each item listed the "Security Alignment" section of the presentation, and provides guidance by attempting to answer three questions.

- **What** does the item mean in this context?

- **Why** does the item need to be addressed?

- **How** would a team go about meeting the item requirements?
