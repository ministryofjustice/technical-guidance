## Introduction

This guidance has been designed to help project teams submitting proposals to the Technical Design Authority (**TDA**) using the [TDA Submission Template](https://justiceuk.sharepoint.com/:p:/r/sites/TechnicalDesignAuthority219/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B82C7FC30-FDB4-4679-AD4E-BD5EDCEFD1A1%7D&file=TDA_Submission_Template_2.0.pptx&action=edit&mobileredirect=true).

Teams are asked to supply details of how their proposal meets specified criteria in three areas - architecture, security and data.

This section contains information on each item listed in the "Security Alignment" section of the presentation, and provides guidance by attempting to answer three questions.

- **What** does the item mean in this context?
- **Why** does the item need to be addressed?
- **How** would a team go about meeting the item requirements?

## Has a security assessment been conducted on this product?

**What?** – A security assessment determines the steps you need to take to make your service secure in accordance with any relevant policies and standards.

**Why?** – To meet the conditions for [point 6 of the Technology Code of Practice (**TCoP**)](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure) your proposal should contain information on the results of any security assessments.

If you’re going through the spend control process you need to explain how you’re meeting [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure).

**How?** – Start by reviewing the “Assess your security and resources” section in [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure). Work through the numbered questions listed to help complete the assessment, including any relevant information in your proposal. Section 9 of the [GOV.UK service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-9-create-a-secure-service) includes guidance on making a service secure and [Govassure](https://www.security.gov.uk/policy-and-guidance/govassure/) provides information on meeting government criteria for cybersecurity assessments.

## Have any security risks been captured?

**What?** – Any security risks captured in the assessment should be recorded and investigated, with a view to developing a solution to prevent them.

**Why?** – To meet the conditions for [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure) your proposal should contain information on detecting and dealing with any known security risks.

If you’re going through the [spend control process](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/spend-controls-check-if-you-need-approval-to-spend-money-on-a-service) you need to explain how you’re meeting [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure).

**How?** – Review the “Assess your security and resources” section in [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure) and apply the guidance on capturing and managing any security risks to your service. Section 9 of the [GOV.UK service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) also includes instructions on managing risk and integrating security measures into your service. Ensure your proposal contains a full breakdown of any known security risks and the measures taken to manage them.

## Does the product include the capability to detect, log and respond to security incidents?

**What?** – If the product is deployed in a public-facing environment, there should be measures in place to handle potential security incidents.

**Why?** – To meet the conditions for [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure) your proposal should contain information on managing security incidents.

If you’re going through the [spend control process](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/spend-controls-check-if-you-need-approval-to-spend-money-on-a-service) you need to explain how you’re meeting [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure).

**How?** – Review the “Using proportionate security for your technology” and “Use continuous improvement planning to manage and update security” sections in [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure), and ensure your proposal contains information demonstrating how your service will comply with any relevant requirements. Section 9 of the [GOV.UK service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) also includes instructions on securing information and testing for vulnerabilities.

## Can the product integrate into the Justice Digital Security Operations Centre?

**What?** – The Justice Digital Security Operations Centre (**SOC**) proactively monitors, detects, analyses and responds to cybersecurity threats and incidents in real time, ensuring the protection of digital assets and data. The point of contact/service owner is currently Graham Inglis.

**Why?** – To meet the conditions for [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure) your proposal should outline any plans for integration with the SOC.

If you’re going through the [spend control process](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/spend-controls-check-if-you-need-approval-to-spend-money-on-a-service) you need to explain how you’re meeting [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure).

**How?** – Review the “Use continuous improvement planning to manage and update security” section in [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure) to help with assurance guidelines on continuous improvement. Contact the SOC to ensure your security requirements are within scope for monitoring and include any relevant information in your proposal.

## Is this product using safe cryptography? (e.g. Quantum safe)

**What?** – To mitigate any future threat from quantum computers, there is a requirement that all government services, systems, and products migrate to post-quantum cryptography (**PQC**) to ensure an adequate level of cybersecurity protection. The requirement is not immediate, but it does need to be considered in any cybersecurity spend forecasts.

**Why?** – To meet the conditions for [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure) your proposal should contain information on building resilience against cybersecurity threats.

If you’re going through the [spend control process](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/spend-controls-check-if-you-need-approval-to-spend-money-on-a-service) you need to explain how you’re meeting [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure).

**How?** – Consult the [PQC guidance page](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pqc-migration-timelines) at the National Cyber Security Centre (**NCSC**) and evaluate how the migration timeline might impact your service. Include any details on potential costs for migration activities in your proposal. Section 9 of the [GOV.UK Service Standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard) also includes instructions on securing a service.

## Is security in-built? (Secure by Design)

**What?** – [Secure by Design](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pqc-migration-timelines) is a government framework used to ensure effective cybersecurity practices are built into any new or updated digital services and infrastructure.

**Why?** –  To meet the conditions for [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure) your proposal should confirm that any system or service components have been designed and implemented according to government best practice.

If you’re going through the [spend control process](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/spend-controls-check-if-you-need-approval-to-spend-money-on-a-service) you need to explain how you’re meeting [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure).

**How?** – Consult the “Network and infrastructure security” section of [TCoP point 6](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/the-technology-code-of-practice#make-things-secure) and the [Secure by Design](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pqc-migration-timelines) site for information on incorporating appropriate cybersecurity solutions into your service. Include details on meeting [Secure by Design](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/pqc-migration-timelines) requirements in your proposal.
