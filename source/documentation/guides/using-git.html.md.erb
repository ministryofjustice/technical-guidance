## Overview

[git][git] is a [distributed version-control system][dvcs]. It's distributed,
in that there's no central source of truth. Each copy of a repository can
contain the entire history, and be considered an authoritative source. But we
tend to use it in a centralised fashion, treating the version that is
[hosted on GitHub](https://github.com/ministryofjustice) as the shared central
version, and basing all work against that copy.

It has excellent tools for branching and merging. Branching is possible in
other version control systems, but merging can be very painful. This made
people tentative about using that workflow.

In git, that problem goes away.

## How-to

### Set up to start contributing

Do not fork – [clone a repo](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository#_git_cloning) from
[https://github.com/ministryofjustice](https://github.com/ministryofjustice)
to your local machine.

### Work locally

[Create a branch](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging#_basic_branching) to work in for your changes.

Before you create a branch, it's worth considering the branch names and how you
think the branch might become visible to other people.

A common prefix can be useful for categorising branches, and working with tools
for continuous integration. Naming branches such as `feature/foo`,
`feature/bar`, and `bug/fix-column-migration` can help other people in the team
understand whether it's a feature (new behaviour) or a fixing a bug. Having a
common prefix can also work well with continuous integration tools such as
[Travis][travis], which might be
[instructed to only do certain actions on branches](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/customizing-the-build#using-regular-expressions)
named `feature/*` versus the `main` branch.

Other approaches:

* `feature/{JIRA-issue}-{description}` – this change is for the Jira issue
  LM-6, and also has a human-readable description to give people more context.
  Also, one or more people might be working on this branch (pairing, or
  separately)
* `jabley/thing` – this branch contains work that developer known as jabley is
  doing. Other people might not want to rely on this branch, since it might be
  force-pushed (but nicely please!)

### Commit locally regularly

This can help to get to the point where you have a working version, and then
want to try adding a new thing. Try to aim for each [commit](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository)
to be an atomic unit that delivers a non-broken version of the code-base. As
you make more changes, consider whether it should be separate commit, or an
amendment to the last one. You can always
[interactively rebase your changes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History)
to edit the commit history to a logical changeset.

### Push your changes regularly

This protects you from local hardware failure, and
[ensures you don't lose your changes](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Working-with-Remotes#_pushing_remotes).

### Request a review

Once you have got to the point where you consider the change complete, you
should [open a pull request on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request),
asking for the changes to be reviewed by someone else on the team.

### Review pull requests

Before commenting on a pull request, ensure you know how the person would
prefer to get feedback. This might involve asking them first. Feedback options
include face-to-face, pairing, via email/Slack, or commenting on a pull request.

Ideally, continuous integration should be set up to provide some feedback on a
pull request (the tests pass, coding style has been followed etc). If not,
you'll probably want to pull the code and try it out for yourself.
