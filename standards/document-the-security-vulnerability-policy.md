# Document the security vulnerability policy for your service

All MOJ production (live) domains **must** use [security.txt](https://securitytxt.org/) in order to document the security vulnerability policy (including contact methods and so on) for your service.

This includes where the domain is primarily operated by a partner (for example, commercial supplier) but the MOJ remains primarily responsible for cyber security of the domain and underlying websites or digital services.

Using security.txt does not preclude you from documenting in other ways, but at minimum security.txt **must** be used.

### How disclosures work

When issues are reported through [cybersecurity+vulnerabilitydisclosure@digital.justice.gov.uk](mailto:cybersecurity+vulnerabilitydisclosure@digital.justice.gov.uk) they are triaged by the [Cyber Security Defensive Security Operations team](mailto:DefensiveSecurityOperationsTeam@digital.justice.gov.uk), who will then contact relevant product/service teams as required.

### MOJ's disclosure policy

Cyber Security maintain the [MOJ vulnerability Disclosure Policy](https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/) as well as the [central security.txt file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ministryofjustice/security-guidance/master/contact/vulnerability-disclosure-security.txt).
