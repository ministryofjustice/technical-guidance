# Using 3rd-party open source products

In order to make effective commercial decisions, it is important to recognise the characteristics of open source software that we find desirable. Many organisations ‘open’ their code, but monetise the software through means that restrict the freedom of the user. Some open source software does not have a strong community, and can be risky to use should problems arise which the MOJ does not understand how to resolve.

The following checklist must be followed, and the risks understood and considered if the criteria is not met.

## A strong community exists to maintain the code

If this is not present, the software presents a sustainability and security risk to the MOJ. There is no established method for assessing the maturity of open source communities, however factors to consider are:

- The activity of its contributors and contributions. Are there lots of people regularly contributing, or are there very few contributions from a low number of individuals?
- The patterns of its release history. Does the code appear to be being regularly maintained and updated, or was it just published and left alone?
- The health and diversity of its community of users. Are we likely to be atypical users of this code, or are others already using it in a similar way to us? 
- Trust established through longevity of use
- The ecosystem it belongs to. Is this code tightly algined or coupled to other products or services, and if so, do they share similar strong community properties?

## The responsiveness of the community to emerging security issues is acceptable, given the context of use

If the open source code is used for a critical security function, the community must be very responsive to emerging vulnerabilities. Equally, a much slower response is acceptable for non-critical code libraries.  

Can you easily identify where security problems should be reported to? Are security updates to the code clearly identified, or are they indistinguisable from other changes? Is there any evidence of the community tracking upstream issues and quickly importing fixes? Do those maintaining and developing the code base appear to understand secure development practices?

## Support for the normal use of the code can be obtained from the community at zero cost

If this is not present, then this is a commercial product, and must be considered alongside other products with licensing or support costs
If not present, then this software would be considered inferior to like-for-like FLOSS alternatives.

## If commercial support is available for advanced use, a marketplace exists to choose between different suppliers

If support for advanced use is only available from a single commercial provider, then this could represent a trap later in development forcing the use of this uncompetitive paid-for support.

## The product is fully open source. Closed source extensions or plug-ins, if they exist, aren’t required for the normal operation or scaling of the product 

If the product is partially closed source, this could introduce commercial implications if the closed source features become essential over time.
