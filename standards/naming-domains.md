# Naming domains

All services with real users and which look like GOV.UK should be on
`*.service.gov.uk` or `*.service.justice.gov.uk`.

### service.gov.uk

The [service standard](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/technology/get-a-domain-name)
already sets out when and how to get a `*.service.gov.uk` subdomain:
public-facing services which have passed their beta assessment should
be able to get one.

### service.justice.gov.uk

All other services with real users and which look like GOV.UK should be
on here, including:

- public-facing services which haven’t yet passed their beta assessment
(but may be in private beta with a restricted set of real users)
- internal services which look like GOV.UK (although [they can’t use the
crown, New Transport font etc](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-your-service-look-like-govuk#if-your-service-isnt-on-govuk))

## Staff-facing sites

Any staff-facing sites which exist as part of public-facing services
should also be on the `*.service(.justice).gov.uk` domain.

For example `staff.prisonvisits.service.gov.uk` is the staff-facing
side of `www.prisonvisits.service.gov.uk`.

## Pre-production environments

This standard includes pre-production environments. For those, use this
domain naming pattern:

`<application>.<environment>.<service-name>.service(.justice).gov.uk`

A real example would be `staff.staging.prisonvisits.service.gov.uk`.

This pattern makes the relationships between domains clear, grouping
environments by service and applications by shared environment.

Pre-production environments and [hosted prototypes](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/design/making-prototypes#sharing-code-prototypes)
should also use authentication (such as HTTP basic auth) to prevent
public users who come across them thinking they’re real.

Pre-production environments can also use different styling as a way of
making it clear to users which environment they’re in - but that’s more
useful for people working on the service to not modify real data in
production than to keep real users out. GOV.UK publishing apps do this,
for example compare GOV.UK Signon in their [Staging](https://signon.staging.publishing.service.gov.uk)
and [Production](https://signon.publishing.service.gov.uk) environments.

## Non .gov.uk domains

Don't use domains other than *.gov.uk for services that look like GOV.UK because sooner or later Google will flag it as a phishing site and Chrome users will be unable to use it. This is the error they see instead:

[

](/images/deceptive-site-alert.png)

Whilst we can get Google to remove the flag, it will keep happening.
